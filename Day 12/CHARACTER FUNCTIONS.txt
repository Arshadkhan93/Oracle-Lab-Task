                         =================
 *
***Dual :- Dual is an oracle predefined virtual table which contains only
 *         one row and one column. Dual table is used to test oracle
           predefined, user defined functions functionality.


    when ever we are installing oracle server then automatically
dual table is created with in SYS user but we are allowed to use
dual table in all other users in oracle database.



 *
***Note:- in oracle by default datatype of the dual table column
 * =====     is varchar2.

 
SQL> select * from dual;

     D    ------->dummy column
   -----
     X

SQL>desc dual;

 Name                Type
-------          ------------
 DUMMY            VARCHAR2(1)



Testing predefined functions functionality:-
==========================================
EX:-
==
sql>select nvl(null,40) from dual;
   
             40

sql>select nvl(20,30) from dual;

             20

     by using dual table we can also perform mathematical
operations.
 

Eg:-
===
SQL> select 100+200 from dual; //one value as result &
                                 work with non table data.

•When we want to get one value as result and we want to work with 
 non table values then use dual.

                          CHARACTER FUNCTIONS
                         =====================

1.Write a query to display employee names to uppercase in 
  emp table 
 
ANS: SQL> SELECT UPPER(ENAME) FROM EMP;

2.Write a query to display all employee names from the emp table
  in lowercase.

ANS: SQL> SELECT LOWER(ENAME) FROM EMP;

3.Update all item names in the ITEM table to upper case
  
ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP;

4.What is the output of the following query

SQL>SELECT INITCAP('ab cd ef') from dual;

a) AB CD EF

b) Ab Cd Ef

c) Ab cd ef

d) ab cd ef


Answer:-b) Ab Cd Ef



5.Write a query to display the employee records whose names having 4 characters
  by using length function from emp table?

ANS: SQL> SELECT ENAME FROM EMP WHERE LENGTH(ENAME)=4;



6.Write a query to display the employee name and the length of each name
  from the emp table by using appropriate character function ?

ANS: SQL> SELECT ENAME, LENGTH(ENAME) AS CHARATER FROM EMP;

7.Write a query to display the employees records whose ename length
  is more than 5 characters from emp table by using length() function?


NOTE:-length function returns total length of string including 
=====       spaces.

ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE LENGTH(ENAME)>5;


8.What the o/p of the following

SQL>select length('AB CD') from dual;

A. 4

B. 5

C. 6

D. None of the above

Answer:-B. 5


9.Check the following lpad() and rpad() queries output

SQL>select lpad('kiran',10,'#") from dual;

OUTPUT: #####kiran


SQL>select lpad('gowtham',10,'$@') from dual;

OUTPUT: $@$gowtham

SQL>select lpad('X',4,'X') from dual;

ANS: XXXX

•The total length specified is 4  

•The original string length is 1 (because 'X' is a single character)

•Total length-string length = 4-1
                            =  3 
  
•3 X's will be printed on left side of the 
 given string. 

•Since the original string is already 'X', after padding with 3 'X's on the left,
 the output becomes 'XXXX'

output:-
=======
XXXX



SQL>select rpad('ABCD',10,'#')from dual;

OUTPUT:  ABCD######

SQL>select rpad('kiran',10)||'hello' from dual;

OUTPUT: kiran     HELLO

SQL>select rpad(ename,20)||sal from emp;

OUTPUT: 
SMITH               800
ALLEN               1600
WARD                1250
