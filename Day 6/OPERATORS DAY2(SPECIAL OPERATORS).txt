                          SPECIAL OPERATORS
                         ====================

1.In:- It is used to pick the values one by one
=====        from list of values.
 

        We can also use in operator in place of OR operator.
when we are retrieving multiple values from the same column.
in this case In operator performance is very high compare to
OR operator.
 

•it avoids writing multiple equality conditions using OR operator.


Syntax:- 
=======
select * from table name
where columnname in(list of values);



1.Write a query to display the employees who are belongs to 20,30,50,70,90 departments from
  emp table by using in operator.

ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20 OR DEPTNO=30 OR DEPTNO=50 OR DEPTNO=70 OR DEPTNO=90;


2.Write a query to display whose enames are SMITH,JONES,KING from emp table
  by using in operator?

ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='SMITH' OR ENAME='JONES' OR ENAME='KING';


3.Write a query to display the employee records whose employee numbers
  are 7902,7788,7900 from emp table by using in operator?

ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=7902 OR EMPNO=7788 OR EMPNO=7900;


4.Write a query to display the employee records whose salary is 1250,3000,5000

                    ======================
2)Between:-This operator is used to retrieve range of values from a table column.
========== This operator is also called as between.... and operator.


Syntax:- 
========
Select * from tablename 
where columnname between lowvalue and highvalue.

         between 2000 to 5000 from emp table 
              by using Between operator? 


ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL BETWEEN 2000 AND 5000;

2.Write a query to display the employees who are getting salary 
        not between 2000 - 5000 from emp table
              by using Between operator?

ANS:SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL NOT BETWEEN 2000 AND 5000;

 
3.Write a query to display the employee records who joined in 1982 from emp table?


ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE BETWEEN '01-JAN-1982' AND '31-DEC-1982';


4.Write a query to display the employee records except joined in 1981 from emp table?

ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE NOT BETWEEN '01-JAN-1981' AND '31-DEC-1981';


 *
*5* What is the output of the following statement?
 *
    SQL>select * from emp where sal between 4000 and 2000;

========================= These two operators are used to test weather a column
                          having null values or not.


•For null comparision we must use is null or is not null operators. 
 don't use = operator.


Syntax:-
========
 select * from tablename where columnname is null;


Syntax:-
=======
 select * from tablename where columnname is not null;


   
1.Write a query to display the employees who are not getting commission
