                               DATE CONVERSION FUNCTIONS
                             ============================

1)to_char():-it is used to convert oracle date type into character type.


EX:-
===
SQL> select to_char(sysdate,'DAY MONTH YYYY') from dual;

TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'DAYMONTHYYYY')
-------------------------------
THURSDAY  DECEMBER  2025


SQL> select to_char(sysdate,'day')from dual;

TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'DAY')
------------------------
thursday

1.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the year 1981
  from emp table using to_char()?

ANS: SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'YYYY')=1981;

2.Write a query to display employee names,Hiredate and 4 digit year from emp table
  by using to_char()?

EXCEPTED OUTPUT:-
===============

   ENAME      HIREDATE       YEAR
 --------    ----------     ------   
  SMITH       17-DEC-80      1980
  ALLEN       20-FEB-81      1981
  -----        -------       ----
  -----        -------       ----
  -----        -------       ----
  MILLER      23-JAN-82      1982

ANS: SQL> SELECT ENAME, TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'YYYY') AS YEAR FROM EMP;

3.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the month DECEMBER
  from emp table by using to_char() month format?

ANS: 
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'MON')='DEC';
			OR
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'FMMONTH')='DECEMBER';
			OR
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'MM')=12;

NOTE:-Whenever we are using to_char() DAY format also oracle
      server internally allocates maximum 9 bytes for DAY field.
whenever passed DAY having less number of bytes then oracle server
does not return any rows.To overcome this problem then we must use
fm(fill mode).



4.Write a query to display the employees records who are joined in 1980,1982,1984
